The goal is to write a program that connects via the GitHub API to the GitHub - lodash/lodash repository
and gathers a couple of statistics.
The program will output statistics on how often each letter is present in the
JavaScript/TypeScript files of the repository, in decreasing order.

Assumptions: 
- Only the 26 letters of the latin alphabet will be considered
- Case-insensitive
-
